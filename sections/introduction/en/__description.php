    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <span>Both HTML markup and CSS styles used in our templates are semantically correct and valid. However some W3C errors still can take place. Making code 100% W3C valid eliminates the usage of modern website technologies as CSS3 features and HTML5 markup. Our goal is to deliver rich user experience with high quality templates and sometimes we have to break some rules.</span>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <p>Before you proceed to set up your Magento store, please make sure you are fully prepared. Please complete the following preparation steps:</p>

    <h4>Editing software</h4>

    <p>To feel comfortable working with Magento template, we recommend downloading all the applications required. You can see the list of required software on the template preview page. </br> The requirements may vary for different templates, for most templates they are the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, you need to use WinZip 9+ (Windows) and Stuffit Expander 10+ (Mac) to extract the password protected sources_#########.zip archive. </li>
        <li>You may also need the Adobe Photoshop application. It is used to edit .PSD source files, and it is necessary if you want to edit template design graphics and images.</li>
        <li>To edit template source code files, you need some code editor like Adobe Dreamweaver, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.</li>
        <li>To upload files to the hosting server you may need an FTP Manager like Total Commander, FileZilla, CuteFTP, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Hosting</h4>
    <p>As Magento Commerce is a PHP/MySQL based application, you need to prepare a hosting environment to run Magento.</p>
    <p>If you have live hosting, please make sure it matches <a href="http://magento.com/resources/system-requirements" target="_blank"> Magento requirements </a> and is ready to be used for Magento store.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you can run Magento locally on your computer using the local server. To create a local hosting server please use the localhost applications such as <strong>WAMP</strong>, <strong>AppServ</strong>, <strong>MAMP</strong> etc. Any of those can be easily installed as any other program and used to run Magento. </p>
    <p>Please check the following tutorials on how to configure the local development environment:</p>
