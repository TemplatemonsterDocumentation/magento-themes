        <div align="justify"><span>Both HTML markup and CSS styles used in our templates are semantically correct and valid. However some W3C errors still can take place. Making code 100% W3C valid eliminates the usage of modern website technologies as CSS3 features and HTML5 markup.

	</p>
	<h5 style="text-align:center;"><strong>High performance platform suitable for projects of all sizes</strong></h5>
	
    <p>As Magento Commerce is a PHP/MySQL based application, you need to prepare a hosting environment to run Magento.</p>
    <p>If you have live hosting, please make sure it matches <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/system-requirements.html" target="_blank"> Magento requirements </a> and is ready to be used for Magento store.</p>
    <p align="justify">Otherwise, you can run Magento locally on your computer using the local server. To create a local hosting server please use the localhost applications such as <strong>WAMP</strong>, <strong>AppServ</strong>, <strong>MAMP</strong> etc. Any of those can be easily installed as any other program and used to run Magento. </p>
  <p>Please check the following tutorials on how to configure the local development environment:</p>
