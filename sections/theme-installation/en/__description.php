<h2 class="item1">Magento template installation</h2>
<p>First of all, please make sure your Magento installation version meets the template requirements. If you are using an outdated version of Magento, you need to upgrade it. Don't forget to back up the files and the database. Magento upgrade instructions are available at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/">Magento Wiki</a> website.</p>
<p>If your Magento engine meets the template requirements, you can start the template installation.  </p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the template package and go to the <b>theme###</b> folder.</li>
    <li>Upload <b>theme###</b> folder contents to the Magento installation directory (upload  "<b>app</b>", "<b>skin</b>" and other folders). These folders contain the theme files. They will not affect your existing files.</li>
</ol>
